## Meteor Desktop localStorage

Because of `Electron` and `meteor-desktop` implementation the builtin `Chrome` localStorage works unreliably.
This package provides a working localStorage substitute for `meteor-desktop`.
Available as `Meteor._localStorage`.

Works only when installed with a `meteor-desktop` plugin -> [`meteor-desktop-localstorage`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/meteor-desktop-localstorage)
